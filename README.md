## Issues to address
1 - support view accross roles, users should view charts, State Admin view chats as well
2 - Super Admin Analytics for different features
3 - Load LGAs on the governor dashboard policy analysis _ claude 7/10/2025
4 - Factor in the isolated Data Analytics Features - 5/10/2025
5 - Plan and execute market listing, farmers pay a token before their goods are listed.
